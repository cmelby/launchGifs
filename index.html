      <p>
        Thank you in advance for checking out our IndieGogo page, we truly
        appreciate all the support.
      </p>
    
      <h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
      <p>
        PHASE Watches was created by a couple of young individuals who are
        passionate about watches and were frustrated with traditional watches’
        lack of customization and high price point.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re inspired by, and enjoy wearing high-quality watches but at a
        reasonable cost. We also found that wearing the same watch day in and
        day out felt boring and wanted interchangeable bands that the apple
        watch has but for a traditional watch.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, an interactable band adds cost where there doesn’t need to
        be. The watch industry is filled with high retail markups for
        low-quality watches, we set out to find a solution.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        So over the past year and a half, we’ve built relationships with leaders
        in the watch industry to refine our exciting collection, custom-made and
        curated specifically for you. With our stylish watch collection, we
        focused on three core details:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The highest quality materials producing a very stylish and minimal
          design
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving you the power to further design your watch with interchangeable
          bands
        </li>
        <li>Offering high-quality timepieces at an affordable cost</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With PHASE Watches, the power is yours to choose what adventure you want
        with our diverse selection of luxury watches. We simply want to be a
        guide to help inspire and empower you with this choice.

      <p>
        There are few things in life that stand the test of time. Things that
        are always on, ever-present and constantly moving forward. Not all
        things need to go digital. With Phase Watches, we’re highly inspired by
        the true, the tried, and the tested. With the idea for our brand born in
        2019, we set out to find high quality luxury timepieces and compliment
        them with premium leather bands and stainless steel straps to create an
        experience of the highest standard. The power is yours to choose what
        adventure you want with our diverse selection of luxury watches. We
        simply want to be a guide to help inspire and empower you with this
        choice. Never settle. A new phase of stylish, high-quality, affordable
        watches is here. A timeless selection that we know you will enjoy for a

        PHASE is <strong>BACKED</strong> with a <strong>warranty</strong>.
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are so confident with the quality and durability of our watches, that
        if something were to happen within the first 1 years, we hope you will
        send it back to us.&nbsp; The warranty includes all internal parts of
        the watch.

      <p>Warranty does not cover&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The life of the battery&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Wear and tear and aging (e.g. scratched crystal; alteration of the color
        and/or material of nonmetallic straps and chains, such as leather,
        textile, rubber; peeling of the plating)&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use,
        lack of care, negligence, accidents (knocks dents, crushing, broken
        crystal, etc.)&nbsp;
      </p>
  
      <h3>What’s the next PHASE?</h3>
      <p>
        We want to create MORE! We want to develop a full line of watches of
        various styles that don’t cost a fortune. Between the interchangeable
        bands and having different styled faces we want you to be able to
        change/customize the watch, you’re wearing every day of the week for the
        price of a mainstream brand but look better doing it.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <h3>So come with us on this journey!</h3>
      <p>
        We want to create a community with our backers. Ultimately it’s you who
        will birth PHASE into reality. We are excited about what the future
        holds and eager to grow with you.&nbsp;
      </p>
    
      <p>Who we are and how it started?</p>
      <p>
        Started by young entrepreneurs Jason and Chris set out to design a
        custom watch that wouldn’t break the bank and looked just as good if not
        better than a name brand watch. We started out as friends, started
        working together on this dream and hope to become business partners with
        you help in this campaign.&nbsp;
